# borscht

A set of crates implementing the [BIRCH algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIRCH). 

Subcrates:
* [BIRCH Implementation](borscht/) -- Core algorithm implementation
* [Visualization Tool](borscht-visualizer/) -- Small tree visualization tool
* [Test Suite](test-suite/) -- Test suite
* [Data Generator](datagen/) -- Random data generator for use with test suite

Still a work in progress. Currently work is mainly around visualizing the generated cluster trees
to debug existing implementation. Documentation is sparse and will be improved once the 
implementation starts to finalize.
