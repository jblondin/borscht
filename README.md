# borscht

A set of crates implementing the [BIRCH algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIRCH). 
Primary crate: [borscht](./borscht/lib.rs)

Still a work in progress. Currently work is mainly around visualizing the generated cluster trees
to debug existing implementation. Documentation is sparse and will be improved once the 
implementation starts to finalize.
